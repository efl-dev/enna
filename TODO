- v5 :

  * Remove libxml2 dependancy.
  * Check if efreet is really need, it's only used in enna_util_init to get cache, config et data directories, we should build our own patch instead ?
  * libcurl is used in url_utils. This part seems to do actually the same as ecore_con_url so remove this old code and use ecore_con instead. 
  * Bind enna event to video player.
  * Select last item in list when back button is pressed. 
  * Fix click event on list
  * remove libvalhalla browser module. Keep libvalhlla as core dependancy for now for metadata grabbing, but remove browser library module.
  * Remove not working browser modules : cdda, dvd, spotify, netstreams, podcast, shoutcast, upnp, valhalla. They need to be fixed to match the browser api. They never worked so remove this code instead of maintaining crap.
  * Remove not working activities modules : bookstore games tv (weather?).
  * Remove hal and udev modules. We need to use E_UDisk now E_HAl does't exist anymore.
  * Fix File header with credits, copyright and licence (which is lgpl)

- v6 :
  * Remove libvalhalla definitively and use our own parser based on EMS.
