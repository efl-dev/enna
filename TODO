- v5 :

  * Remove libxml2 dependancy.
  * Check if efreet is really need, it's only used in enna_util_init to get cache, config et data directories, we should build our own patch instead ?
  * libcurl is used in url_utils. This part seems to do actually the same as ecore_con_url so remove this old code and use ecore_con instead. 
  * Bind enna event to video player.
  * Fix File header with credits, copyright and licence (which is lgpl)

- v6 :
  * Remove libvalhalla definitively and use our own parser based on EMS
  * E_Udisk for disk detection.
